# Search for an organizations GitHub

React web application to get all of the repositories from a github organization and display the results on a web page. Organizations can be searched for and repositories can be pressed to find all of the commits done in that repository.

## Installation

In the project directory, you run npm install and then run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
